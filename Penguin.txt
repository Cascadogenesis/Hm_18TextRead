Penguins are flightless birds found in the Southern Hemisphere, 
particularly in Antarctica. 
These charming birds are known for their black and white plumage,
 which helps them blend in with their icy surroundings. Penguins 
are excellent swimmers and spend most of their time in the water
 hunting for fish and krill. They live in colonies, where they
 protect each other from predators and harsh weather. Unfortunately,
 climate change and overfishing are threatening penguin populations,
 making conservation efforts critical.
