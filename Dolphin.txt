Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals
 known for their playful behavior and complex 
communication skills. They live in groups called pods, 
where they cooperate in hunting and protecting each
 other from predators. Dolphins use echolocation to 
navigate and find food in the water. These friendly
 creatures are found in oceans around the world, but 
some species are endangered due to habitat destruction, 
pollution, and fishing nets. Protecting dolphins is vital 
for maintaining the health of marine ecosystems.
