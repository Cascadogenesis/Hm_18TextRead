The tiger is a powerful and beautiful predator,
 native to Asia. With its striking orange coat and black stripes, 
it is one of the most recognizable animals in the world.
 Tigers are solitary hunters, relying on their strength 
and stealth to catch prey. They are also skilled swimmers,
 often found near water. Sadly, tigers are endangered due
 to poaching and habitat destruction. Protecting their 
natural habitat is essential to the survival of this magnificent species.
