Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. 
They are known for their massive size, long trunks,
 and large ears. These gentle giants live in herds,
 led by the oldest female. Elephants are highly 
intelligent and social creatures. They use their
 trunks to grab food, drink water, and even communicate with each other.
 Unfortunately, elephants face threats from poaching and habitat loss.
 Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure these magnificent 
animals survive for future generations.
